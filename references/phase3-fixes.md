## Fix Guidelines

### Order of execution
Fix issues in this order:
1. **CRITICAL** — Security vulnerabilities, crashes, data loss
2. **HIGH** — Incorrect behavior, data integrity
3. **MEDIUM** — Code smells, maintainability
4. **LOW** — Style, conventions

### What to fix
- Incorrect logic, missing validation, security holes
- Wrong types, missing error handling, broken integrations
- Naming inconsistencies, dead code, unused imports

### What NOT to fix without asking
- Architectural decisions (even if suboptimal)
- Business logic that might be intentional
- Performance optimizations that change behavior
- Removing code that looks unused but might be used dynamically
- Changes that affect public APIs or interfaces

### Fix quality rules
- Each fix must be the **minimum change** to resolve the issue
- Do not refactor, restructure, or "improve" surrounding code
- Preserve existing code style and conventions
- If unsure whether a fix is safe, ask the user
- After fixing, verify the fix doesn't introduce new issues in the immediate context
